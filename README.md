# Certificate_Checker
This code will allow you to compare information from two different sources: a txt file and a json file.
The objective is to know which information must be absolutely verified with precision and which information is correct.

You will find:
- the python document with the code
- two txt files to test the code
- two jpg files to see the real certificate. The txt files are created by reading these two jpg files
- a json file that represents the database with the certificate information
